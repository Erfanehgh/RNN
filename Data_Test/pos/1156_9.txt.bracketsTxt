However, the Raisuli has less sinister plans for the Pedecarises,'), (8, "who are more than capable of handling themselves in any event.<br /><br />John Milius's great historical film,"), (9, 'based VERY loosely off of a true story (i.e. Pedecaris was a middle-aged man), is a wonderful bit of escapism. It has some amazing action scenes, a witty, well-written script, a fine cast enjoying themselves with the material, and does not overstay its welcome like, say, "Pirates of the Caribbean" or the "Lord of the Rings" movies. It\'s not really an "epic" film in the strictest sense, but it\'s one of the best pure action movies ever made.<br /><br />While the historical context is shaky, the storyline is interesting, and as some reviewers point out, it is even more pertinent today than it was when made. As President Roosevelt says, "America is like a grizzly bear" - fierce, strong, but a little blind and reckless at times.

In real life, it didn\'t quite work out that way, but allegorically it works well. While written from a right-wing perspective, Milius\'s screenplay is pretty accurate in assessing America and its place in the world.

There are some brilliantly done action scenes, such as Raisuli's rescue of the Pedecaris's from double-crossing tribesmen,"), (15, 'which features some of the best swordplay in any film.'), (16, 'The opening entrance of the Raisuli and the aforementioned march and attack of the US Marines are brilliantly done bravura set pieces. And the final battle,'), (17, 'which combines elements of "Lawrence of Arabia" and "The Wild Bunch", while a major historical fantasy (a three-way battle between Germans, Americans, and the Rifs), is a superbly staged, adrenaline-pumping sequence.<br /><br />The excellent cast gives some wonderful performances.
