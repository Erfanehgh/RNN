But I predict that out of the 18 main actors, at least 11 will quickly become very well-known in the movie and TV scene over here. It\'s great to see so many fresh and at the same time talented faces. Well-done!<br /><br />For those'), (5, 'who want to read more, here\'s a rundown of all 18 actors:(spoilers!)<br /><br />Sebastian Weber: Silent waters are deep! Memorize his "Flower garden" monologue, you can win any woman\'s heart with this one.<br /><br />Anna B\xc3\xb6ger: A hell of a woman! Every time she opens her mouth,'), (6, 'you can\'t help but laugh and feel good. Listen how she pronounces "asshole" and calls the pink shirt guy a "B\xc3\xbcrscherl"!<br /><br />Felix Hellmann: The "B\xc3\xbcrscherl" from above is fun to watch. The inconvenient truth is that there are too many of those guys around. His looks somewhat reminded me of Flo Weber of "Sportfreunde Stiller".<br /><br />Katharina Schubert: This woman has everything: love, hope, despair, beauty. Her "do'), (7, 'you want children" scene is a classic. A great actress of whom we will hear again, no doubt.<br /><br />David Baalcke: Now is this guy a loser or not? Almost as authentic as Paul Giamatti in "Sideways". I hope this is NOT method acting.<br /><br />Julia Koschitz: The "good looking" woman in the circle. Julia used to play theater in my hometown, kudos! I think'), (8, 'she will appear in many TV series to come.<br /><br />Martin Butzke: The revolutionary guy catches the cutest and most conventional woman in the end. Would you like to share a taxi with this guy?<br /><br />Kathrin von Steinburg: She gave a stunning performance in "Tatort" last year. Her trance-like performance in this movie is no less. SEE her beautiful face'), (9, 'and HEAR her dirty laugh. The best scene in the movie belongs to her. <br /><br />Matthias Bundschuh: I know these "write down everything"-guys back from school. I\'m not sure whether the hot blond got her allergic reaction because of him or his cat. Matthias\' portrayal of such a chicken is outstanding. <br /><br />Mediha Cetin: The sister-in-law of my ex-girl-friend was the same talker like her. The day I met her was the only day in my life I needed tranquilizers, so bad remembrances here.<br /><br />Thomas Limpinsel: The "nice and desperate guy" in the circle. Limpinsel has a comical talent'), (10, 'that is way better than most so-called "comedians" on TV.<br /><br />Lisa Wagner: The victim of Sebastian\'s "flower garden" metaphor. Lisa\'s face is funny and full of melancholy, her story made me feel good and sad at the same time, wow!<br /><br />Oliver B\xc3\xbcrgin: The "good looking" man in the circle. No wonder'), (11, 'he catches Julia in the end. These two really fit together. I think'), (12, 'he will appear in many TV series to come.<br /><br />Julia Heinze: The "cute, conventional" woman. I hope she won\'t be underrated: Julia\'s face changes from naive to hurt to furious are great! <br /><br />Stephan Zinner: The "nature boy" from Partenkirchen likes cooking, eating \xc2\x96 and good sex. Watch the body language between him and the hot blond! Zinner usually plays CSU politician S\xc3\xb6der on stage!<br /><br />Anja Klawun: The "bargain girl" has some good moments, but, beg your pardon, fails (like most actors) in playing a drunk on screen.<br /><br />Christian Pfeil: Plays the arrogant and narcissistic guy. Couldn\'t believe'), (13, 'that this very actor owns two art-house cinemas in Munich. <br /><br />Tanja Schleiff: Plays the girl'), (14, "who sleeps with every man around. I'm sure many male visitors will go for her. I have heard she can do dramatic roles as well, so I'm curious.")], 'Satellite', 'elaboration')
