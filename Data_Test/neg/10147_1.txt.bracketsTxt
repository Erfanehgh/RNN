Somehow, this cheap, wretched manure manages to avoid lewdness, but it remains terrible! I couldn\'t believe my eyes--for once I can\'t complain about excessive (or in this case, any) nudity in a slasher film, but it still managed to make me crimson with embarrassment for renting it. Never before have I seen such horrible acting, dialect, direction, writing,....I could go on forever with this list! Here\'s a quick run-down:<br /><br />A mental patient somehow escapes from the loony bin, dresses up like a surgeon, somehow finds out where his doctor lives, and breaks in while the doctor\'s daughter is having friends over for the night.
