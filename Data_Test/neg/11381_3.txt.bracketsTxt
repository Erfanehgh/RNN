((1, 1), [(1, '"Ghost Son" is Lamberto Bava\'s best film and, at the same time, also his worst. I suppose that statement requires some slight clarification. It\'s his best because it\'s well directed, ambitious, accessible and very stylish, but his worst because it\'s a dull, unoriginal movie and undeniably a huge letdown to all the real fans of Bava\'s past efforts.
