This show is appropriately named. It is indeed a show about "The Mind of Mencia." It\'s Mencia\'s mind, through and through, and, as such, is nothing more than dumb entertainment. The show is tailor-made to give life lessons to its core audience, 14-24 year olds, about how stereotypes are bad, but that racial bashing is alright to Carlos Mencia, and therefore should be alright to you!')], 'Satellite', 'elaboration')
