Not only was the plot stupid, it was a complete ripoff of 24 and a bad ripoff at that. The filming style was the now overused "docu-action" look, complete with cuts to grainy B&W "rawcore" footage. I\'m not quite sure what that means, but it sure sounds like something the DP said to the director before filming. I don\'t know what they were going for here')], 'Satellite', 'condition')
