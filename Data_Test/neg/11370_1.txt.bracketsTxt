But then one of the terrorists decides to go it alone and actually blow up the plant because he's kind of crazy. So maybe there is a threat after all. But the army goes in and all the bad guys are killed. So there was no threat. Oh, and a good guy is killed too. Let that be a lesson to everybody.<br /><br />If all of this sounds muddled and kinda of a waste of time then you got the idea of what watching Meltdown is all about.<br /><br />The script never bothers to introduce the characters or to even give any personal details"), (6, "that might flesh them out or emotionally involve the audience. So we're left with one dimensional characters: the-expert-that-nobody-will-listen-to; the-trigger-happy-sergeant; the-slimy-politicians; the-dweeby-Engineers. The story skips from one clich\xc3\xa9 incident to the next in a formula composite of practically every action movie you've ever seen. But at nearly every turn, just when we think"), (7, "something may be at stake the script flinches and we find out there's actually nothing to worry about.<br /><br />Like Die Hard, there's an police officer who's on the inside, unbenownst to the bad guys. The big twist is that the cop here is....A WOMAN! Oh and she's injured too. But not that bad, just enough"), (8, 'to make her wince a couple times. Oh and instead of the walkie talkie'), (9, 'that Bruce Willis had this cop has a magic cell phone'), (10, "that works everywhere...even underground!

He even makes a joke once but we\'re afraid his face might crack. After all, this is serious business.<br /><br />But mostly it\'s scene after scene of people arguing: the Military expert is arguing to wait it out (his reasoning doesn\'t seem particularly sound but he\'s supposed to be the smart guy in this movie so okaaaay); the people at the White House argue with him; the army sergeant argues with him too; the nice Pakistani Nuclear Engineer argues with the main terrorist. The dialogue is absolutely B Movie all the way and lines like, "stop the broadcast! STOP THE BROADCAST!!!" may have you in rolling off your sofa as you wonder'), (12, "if the characters are actually referring to this silliness.<br /><br />Maybe to compensate for the lack of production quality the camera-work is kept jittery in that faux documentary 21 Grams style that's supposed to lend immediacy and energy to the scenes but the way it's indiscriminately and amateurishly applied here it's downright annoying; even pretentious. Further attempts to ratchet up the tempo are made with the inclusion of nonsensical black and white footage that's randomly intercut with the main action. But this, too, is pretentious and annoying in that Blair Witch kinda way."), (13, 'In short, the stylistic attempts look very amateurish.<br /><br />The music lives up to the visuals - it\'s synthy and cheap sounding. Sort of like a porn movie but with less melody and lots more heart beat sounds. The graphic treatment is howlingly bad too: cheesy graphics in huge red font scream out to us "9:28 pm" as though the timeclock actually makes some kind of difference.<br /><br />Meltdown may work as a marketing concept but it\'s clear that the script was a second thought. FX - part of Fox - put this cheesy production together and dropped'), (14, "several million dollars on it. Now THAT'S what I call a meltdown!")], 'Satellite', 'elaboration')
