All I remember from the night is we were the only ones in the theater, and that I didn\'t really like it very much. I blacked the rest out, and for good reason.<br /><br />A poor film on par with the greats like "Gymkata" and "The Pumaman," "No Holds Barred" is a movie set in the high stakes world of pro wrestling. Well maybe the stakes aren\'t all that high...and quite frankly I feel dirty just calling these people "professionals" at anything. And really, except for the first scene, there\'s no wrestling to speak of. So I guess movie is about the marginally low stakes world of amateurish beating-the-c***-out-of-people. Sounds good, right?<br /><br />Hulk Hogan plays Rip, the champion of the WWF (Never let it be said')], 'Nucleus', 'span')
