Director Jean-Paul Rappeneau co-wrote the script to his well-received film "Bon Voyage" (2003). Unlike director Bertrand Tavernier\'s "Safe Conduct" aka "Laissez-passer" (2002), w-d Rolf Schubel\'s "Gloomy Sunday" (1999), or w-d Claude Berri\'s "Lucie Aubrac" (1997), "Bon Voyage" is as chipper as its title sounds - c\'est la vie (whatever) - and we have the beautiful talented Isabelle Adjani to thank for. It is her delightful performance throughout as the center of attraction (and attention), the cause and effect of it all, that made the film so enjoyable as it is. Hell, what\'s another derailment of her plan and expectations')], 'Nucleus', 'span')
