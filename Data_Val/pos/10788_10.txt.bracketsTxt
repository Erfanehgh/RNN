Along with the best performance of 80\'s cinema by Eric Bogosian, for me (along with JFK)this remains Stone\'s finest moment. Stone doesn\'t seem to comment much on it these days and didn\'t do a director\'s commentary on DVD like all his other films. Stone has nothing to be ashamed of, most directors would kill to get a shot @ a film like this.<br /><br />The claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of Champlain are still very crucial arguments for today. The "legalise all drugs" speech is powerful and you might find yourself agreeing with him.In my opinion the film is about freedom of speech and how sometimes people don\'t like hearing things they don\'t agree with.The speeches and conversations with the listeners are very compelling, even disturbing, a chill ran down my spine')], 'Nucleus', 'span')
