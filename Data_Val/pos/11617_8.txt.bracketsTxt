((1, 1), [(1, '"Subconscious Cruelty" has to be one of the most disturbing films I\'ve ever seen. "Salo" and "Cannibal Holocaust" didn\'t bother me that much, but there\'s a strange psychological element to "Subconscious Cruelty". This film invades your subconscious mind with shocking taboos, surrealist visuals and one of the most unsettling film scores and sound designs. Repulsive at times; yes, but its visual flair can be compared to Avant Gard directors such as Alejandro Jodorowsky, Dario Argento, Dusan Makavejev and David Lynch. Take the most extreme elements of those 4 directors')], 'Nucleus', 'span')

This part of the film made me think of Jodorowsky\'s "the Holy Mountain", "Sweet Movie" and "Cannibal Holocaust". I\'ve never been more disturbed in my life by what I witnessed.
