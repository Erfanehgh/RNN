Oh yeah, and there's a drug-dealing ex-boyfriend, a couple of fellow juvees, and a co-worker of Pearl's with whom he has an affair on his long distance girlfriend with (played by Kerry Washington).<br /><br />Sorry if all that synopsis and character breakdown took so long. If it seemed meaningless and boring, then you've just experienced a bit of what I did during the 108 minutes"), (20, "I spent watching the movie. But the unruly supporting cast of over-wrought clich\xc3\xa9s is the least of this film's crimes. The biggest one is that the whole exercise is entirely pointless. We aren't"), (21, "given a fascinating look into a troubled mind, we aren't"), (22, "given an effective explanation, we aren't"), (23, "given much of anything. Given that it sucked so much, I'm gonna go ahead and spoil the ending for you so that you never have to see it: Leland stabbed the retard because all Leland could see in the world was sadness,"), (24, "and wanted to spare Corky (or whatever the victim's name was) the sadness in his eyes. It's like the worst emo band in the world made an album,"), (25, 'and titled it "The World Is Sad, So I Killed A Retard".

Of course he dies in the end, because that made the movie so deep.<br /><br />I\'m giving the movie 2 stars,'), (26, 'because the actors themselves all did a pretty good job with the junk they were given. The scenes with Cheadle and Gosling together were even interesting on some levels. But, to paraphrase the film itself, you have to believe'), (27, 'that movies are more than the sum of their parts, kiddo.')], 'Nucleus', 'same_unit')
