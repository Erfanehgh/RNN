"The General", made just five years after "Schindler\'s List" is not. The cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys'), (10, 'that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that I found simply annoying. The filmmakers were obviously going for a realist\'s documentary-like style, like "Schindler\'s List" did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classic-style motion picture. Performances in the film range from passable to poor. Brendan Gleeson and Jon Voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. The sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime-noir appeal, but that also fails because again, it\'s made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.<br /><br />But the worst thing'), (11, "that occurs is that there's not one\xc2\x97not one\xc2\x97character in the film that"), (12, 'I felt any emotions or opinions for.
