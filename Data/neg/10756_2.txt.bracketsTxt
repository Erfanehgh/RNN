They are, in effect, willing to turn off their critical thinking skills (or maybe they never had them!) for the duration of the movie. Case in point, I Robot. While supposedly based on Asimov\'s short stories and named after one of his novels, it contains little of what Asimov wrote and even less of what he tried to tell us about humanity and our robotic creations. (Those of you'), (8, 'that will run out'), (9, "and buy I, Robot will be very much surprised-this movie isn't even based on that story at all!) <br /><br />The film has enormous plot holes, that at some points are stretched to the limits of credulity. I won't point them out. I won't spoon feed you. You need to practice"), (10, 'you thinking skills and discover them for yourself. The characters,'), (11, "which are named after many of Asimov's characters, do not possess the critical intelligence"), (12, "that was a hallmark of his stories. The plot itself with all it's action sequences goes against everything that the author stood for. His belief that humanity possesses the capacity to solve problems using their minds, not their fists, is vital to understanding his vision of the future. In short, other than the name, their is very little of Isaac in anything about this movie. There will always be those uncritical (i.e. unthinking)"), (13, 'who will state: "The movie doesn\'t have to be like the book. Due to the medium, movies sometimes require that changes be made." But what about a case where the movie never even tried to stay close to the book (or books) from the start? What if all they took from the written work was the title? This begs the question: Why tarnish a great body of work by slapping it\'s title on your vacuous piece of crap? Save money and don\'t buy the rights to the works. Title it something else. Don\'t use the character\'s names. Believe me no one will accuse you of plagiarism. In fact it won\'t matter what you title it to the unread moviegoer'), (14, 'who accepts everything you throw at him. But it will upset those'), (15, 'who read,'), (16, 'who think,'), (17, "who are unwilling to simply let you give them a pretty light show. <br /><br />I, Robot, like much of Hollywood's take on the genre, pushes Science fiction back down into that basement it lived in years ago. Hollywood could not do this alone. It takes an uncritical mindless audience"), (18, 'that will accept puerile dredge like this.')], 'Satellite', 'elaboration')
