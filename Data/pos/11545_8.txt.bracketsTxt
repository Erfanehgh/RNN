He says, "Who wants food?" One of his poker player buddies asks, "What do ya got?" Oscar says, "I got brown sandwiches and green sandwiches." "What\'s the brown?" It\'s either very new cheese or very old meat!" I also love the line about Oscar\'s refrigerator, "It\'s been out of order for two weeks, I saw milk standing in there')], 'Nucleus', 'span')
