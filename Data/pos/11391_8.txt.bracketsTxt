One can imagine just what Kelly was made of as he made this film only a year before "Singin\' In The Rain". He is definately one of the all time greats. It is interesting to look at the parallels between the two films, especially in Kelly\'s characters, the only main difference being that one is based in Paris, the other in L.A.<br /><br />Some have said')], 'Nucleus', 'span')
