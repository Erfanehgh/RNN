You know it\'s a classic the moment its insistent theme song, \'Everybody\'s Talking\' starts up on the soundtrack, (actually not written for the film), and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck, (naked and in the shower).

Adapted, (brilliantly), by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial American movie to deal with \'taboo\' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner.
