((1, 1), [(1, '"Mal\xc3\xa9fique" is an example of how a horror film can be effective with nothing more than a well-executed plot and a lot of heart. Its cast doesn\'t have recognized names, it doesn\'t have a big budget and it certainly lacks in the visual effects aspect; but it compensates all that with an intelligent and well-written script, an effective cast and the vision of a director focused more on telling the story than in delivering cheap thrills. Eric Valette may not be a well-know name yet, but with "Mal\xc3\xa9fique", his feature length debut, he proves he is at the level of contemporaries like Jeunet, Gans or Aja.<br /><br />The film is the story of four prisoners in a cell, four different men with very different backgrounds but with one single goal: to get out. Carr\xc3\xa8re (G\xc3\xa9rald Laroche) gets imprisoned after being declared guilty of a multi-millionaire fraud; his cell-mates, the violent Marcus (Clovis Cornillac), the intellectual Lassalle (Philippe Laudenbach) and the mentally challenged P\xc3\xa2querette (Dimitri Rataud), are all convicted for murder')], 'Nucleus', 'span')
