A creepy partner of Sloane's is along for the sail around the country to set off a number of peculiar events"), (10, 'that has Welles\' "Michael O\'Hara" head spinning. Welles narrates the picture as O\'Hara, but things are still unclear throughout. See for yourself and realize that it takes at least 2 viewings to fully know exactly what\'s up.<br /><br />An uncharacteristically strange courtroom sequence centers around "O\'Hara", with Sloane defending him. It is an oddly comedic scene with some quirky courtroom methods, including Sloane cross-examining himself. I didn\'t really laugh here because the film stalls at this point after a first portion'), (11, 'that never gets to take off anyway. Up to this point, the cinematography is great, some scenes are shot with craft and skill (aquarium love scene), but there is no distinct line drawing the elements'), (12, "and us, the audience, in. Reportedly, the court scene was re-shot against Welles' requests (10 closeups of Hayworth were ordered) and a makeshift song sung by the starlet was thrown in at Cohn's insistence. A gaudy score infuriated Welles,"), (13, 'who once again, was left out of the editing process. Thank Welles himself for saving the film entirely with a tour-de-force ending that will always be treasured. The so-called "Hall of Mirrors" scene brings buffs back time and time again, rightfully so.<br /><br />It must be seen to be believed and it does a good job of wrapping up some confusing ideas presented. The crash of the mirrors represents "O\'Hara\'s" disillusionment and the "crazy house" itself is a masterpiece of art and set decoration. It seems more like a state of mind than an actual place'), (14, 'and is indeed "crazy", twisted and turned like a Dali painting. This is a great ending to a flawed picture that if left alone would probably have made the AFI\'s Top 100. Then again, 3 or 4 more of Orson Welles films may have made all collective "best of" lists if he had been left alone'), (15, 'to create his own magic.<br /><br />NOTE: Look for the Mercury Players'), (16, 'that are so prominent in Welles pictures. They pop up all over. RATING: 8 of 10')], 'Satellite', 'elaboration')
